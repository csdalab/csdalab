# Open positions

Thank you for your interest in joining the CSDA Lab.

## Undergraduate and graduate students

If you are interested in a rotation in the CSDA Lab, please email Dr. Cohen (acohen@uwf.edu) and Dr. Pu (spu@uwf.edu). We are primarily a data-driven lab on statistical modeling, computational statistics, predictive models, and machine learning applications. So, a background in coding helps students make the most of their experience.

## **Research Assistant Position**
We are looking for dedicated graduate students or senior undergraduate students with a background in mathematics/statistics and computer science.
