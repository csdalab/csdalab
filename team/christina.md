### Overview

Greetings to everyone! I am originally from Manta, Ecuador an International Port located by the Pacific Ocean. 

The United States adopted me since I was born; however, I came into my journey here in Tampa, Florida on January of 1994, where I acquired two A.S. Degrees one in Interior Design and the other on Architecture. 

I decided to make a move in my career to Statistics inspired by working for the Census Bureau as a Field Representative. 

I love to sing, cook, volunteer, and practice karate.

I am a mother of three and a grandmother of two looking forward to succeed in the Statistics world.
