### Overview

Hello everyone my name is David Moe and Iâ€™m currently studying Computer Science at the Hal Marcus College of Science and Engineering, University of West Florida and will be starting the Masters of Science in Data Science - Analytics and Modeling program this Spring 2025 at the University of West Florida. 



My background is in finance with a Masters of Science in Finance from Florida State University. After graduating I worked for a small hedge fund as a financial analyst and assistant trader on the options desk. 



I am excited to be a part of the team and I look forward to working together. 



Fun Fact: In my free time I enjoy being active. I also like singing and dancing.
