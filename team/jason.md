### Overview

Hello, everyone, from Jacksonville, FL!

I did my undergraduate studies at the University of Florida, graduating in 1999, and have been working in Information Technology / Software Development since then. The majority of those years have been at McKesson. 
I am a father of two daughters: one is beginning her last year of high school and the other will be starting her sophomore year at UF.

I love to travel and some of my favorite locations have been Brazil, Ukraine, Iceland, and Alaska.


### Short description of your current research project:

Iâ€™m preparing to change the course of my career to Artificial Intelligence and have enjoyed learning all the important math and stats which are at its foundation.
