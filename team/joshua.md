### Overview
Joshua J. Cook, M.S., ACRP-PM, CCRC is a recent graduate of Wake Forest University (WFU) where he earned his Master of Science for Clinical Research Management. 
He is a current graduate student at the University of West Florida (UWF) studying Data Science and working at the Andrews Research & Education Foundation (AREF) in Florida. 
Joshua has been working in the field of clinical research for nearly three years, starting in neurology clinical trials and now specializing in orthopedic regenerative medicine as a Research Quality Analyst. 
He has published his undergraduate honors thesis, entitled “Endurance exercise-mediated metabolic reshuffle attenuates high-caloric diet-induced non-alcoholic fatty liver disease” in the Annals of Hepatology and has recently submitted several 
orthopedic research papers to various journals as part of AREF. He has also presented his research at over ten unique conferences at the local, state, and national levels with topics spanning from the impact of blood sugar on Alzheimer’s Disease to
publication metric tracking with R and Microsoft Power BI®. Joshua has developed a passion for bench-to-bedside research and aims to synthesize his knowledge of the biomedical sciences, clinical research, and data science to become a physician-scientist
capable of integrating clinical care with clinical research in a way that maximizes evidence-based care options for his patients.

 

### Short description of your current research project:
Joshua is currently focused on integrating his newly acquired skills in data science with his background in clinical research. Specifically, he aims to utilize his understanding of time series models to predict future enrollment into orthopedic clinical trials, as well as develop a reproducible statistical methodology for use in consensus statements, which are common in high-risk clinical research studies.

#### Prediction of Orthopedic Clinical Trial Enrollment Rates
Team: Joshua J. Cook, M.S., ACRP-PM, CCRC
Faculty Mentor: Achraf Cohen, Ph.D.
Goal: 3 Minute Thesis (3MT) 2023 (Submitted 10OCT2023); Ongoing Research Project
Summary: Clinical research is pivotal for advancing patient care across various medical domains, including orthopedic surgery and sports medicine. One common challenge in clinical research is the failure to meet study enrollment targets, which has profound implications ranging from financial burdens to affecting the study's statistical power and clinical generalizations. When enrollment goals aren't met, the statistical power to detect significant group differences is hampered, undermining the study's validity, generalizability, and translational potential. Such studies often lack representation of the target population's diversity, leading to healthcare disparities. Additionally, under-enrollment can stall the regulatory approval of novel treatments, impacting sponsors, researchers, and importantly, patients. It also results in financial implications due to increased costs and resource wastage. To anticipate enrollment rates, clinical research sites conventionally undertake feasibility assessments before agreeing to conduct a study. Many sponsors mandate these assessments, encompassing evaluations of therapeutic expertise, past research exposure, staffing needs, and projected enrollment figures. Notably, these evaluations are typically performed by clinical research coordinators without a quantitative analysis of historical enrollment data. Bieganek Et Al. (2022) posited that accurately forecasting which studies will achieve enrollment goals is invaluable for sponsors, sites, and patients. Consequently, this study's objective is to construct time series models that can predict monthly orthopedic clinical trial enrollment rates by leveraging past enrollment data.
 

#### Statistical Considerations in the Development of a Consensus Statement
Team: Joshua J. Cook, M.S., ACRP-PM, CCRC, Joshua Stillman, B.S., Andrew Jimenez, B.S., M1
Faculty Mentor: Achraf Cohen, Ph.D.
Goal: Conference on Statistical Practice (CSP) 2024 Poster (Accepted 03OCT2023); Ongoing Research Project
Summary: Consensus statements serve as a key method to synthesize expert opinions, particularly in areas with limited empirical evidence or when traditional research is deemed not feasible (ex: in high-risk indications). The intricacies involved in designing and analyzing consensus statement studies require distinct statistical considerations to ensure the validity and reliability of outcomes. Here, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the statistical considerations involved in developing a consensus statement. A focus was placed on the statistical thresholds for defining a 'consensus,' exploring the balance between agreement percentage and rounds conducted and determining the appropriate and acceptable power for consensus statement studies. The importance of feedback and the challenge of participant attrition across multiple rounds (as utilized in the Delphi method) were also considered. This study emphasizes the iterative nature of consensus statement building and the necessity for clear statistical considerations in both the design and interpretation phases to ensure the validity of the consensus statement.
