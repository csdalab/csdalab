### Overview

My name is Kellie! I am a junior finishing up my undergraduate degree in biomedical sciences. Afterwards, I hope to go to dental school and gain my D.M.D. 

I enjoy weight lifting, wax sculpting, cooking, and teaching. 

Fun fact: I have two roborovski hamsters, and in my spare time I make houses for them.
