### Overview

Maxime is a French student who freshly arrived at UWF in order to get a master degree in data science by the end of the 2024 summer semester. I am from Vichy in the middle of the France and I am studying industrial engineering (quality and reliability in particular) for 2 years now. I am planning to end my studies in August 2025 and then start working in Europe. I like sport a lot, I played rugby in club for 6 years before and now I prefer riding a mountain bike and exploring landscapes. I also like a lot mathematics and French literature, those two things brought me to do studies, now I just have to get graduated and start playing the real-life.
