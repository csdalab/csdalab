### Overview

Hello all, I am from Pennsylvania. I have a BS in Chemical Engineering. I am pursuing an MS Degree in Data Science and will be doing exciting research using machine learning algorithms. I am very excited to be part of this growing field.


I used to work as a chemist at an industrial gas company analyzing chemical composition. I realized the work wasnâ€™t for me in the long term. I came across the Data Analytics field working at JnJ as a sterile scientist and found that data analytics has a tremendous impact on making important discoveries. 


I am honored to be here. I am very excited to work with my team to tackle difficult problems using data.

Fun Fact: I like spicy foods and enjoy games
