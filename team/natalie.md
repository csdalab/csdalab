Certificate in Supply Chain Logistics Management at the University of West Florida (UWF). Shortly
thereafter at UWF, she earned a Master of Business Administration with an emphasis in Business
Analytics and a Graduate Certificate in Supply Chain Logistics Management. While earning the MBA, she
worked as a teaching assistant for UWF’s Information Systems Management Department where she
tutored management science students, particularly in linear programming and optimization modeling.
