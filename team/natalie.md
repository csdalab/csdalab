### Overview

Hi!

I’m Natalie Belford. I’m from Pensacola but moved around a bit before coming back to finish my I have
a bachelor’s in finance and logistics. I’ve since stayed and earned an MBA in business analytics
and logistics. Working as a TA during my MBA program, I discovered my love of academia. 

I’m currently finishing a Master of Science in Data Science with a concentration in Analytics and Modeling.
I have had two academic journal articles published; one solo-authored outlining the benefits of using
optimization modeling to develop a contingency plan during a pandemic. The article has since been
published in the Journal of Cybersecurity Education, Research and Practice (JCERP). The second
paper I co-authored with a pedagogical research team. The research purpose was to engage students
in optimization modeling. The article has since been published in INFORM’s Transactions on
Education (ITE).

My research interests include optimization modeling, logistics, and global nutrition studies. It’s an
honor to be a part of this group.

Fun and boring facts about me: I love reading, weightlifting, and word searches.
