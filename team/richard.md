### Overview

My name is Richard Odgers. I hold a Bachelor of Science in Psychology from Idaho State University where I have participated in research with delayed discounting and behavioral pharmacology.

I am a newly accepted student here at the University of West Florida for the data science program.

I am looking forward to expanding my research experience, learning more on how to apply my current knowledge, as well as building upon it.
