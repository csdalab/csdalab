### Overview

Hello everyone! My name is Sassou Khabou and I am currently a graduate student pursuing my M.S. in Data Science at UWF.

I attended FSU from 2015-2019 and obtained my B.S. in Chemistry. While at FSU, I did research on perovskite LEDs and published a paper, titled “Manganese-Doped One-Dimensional Organic Lead Bromide Perovskites with Bright White Emissions”. 


After graduating from FSU, I took a gap year and decided to apply for medical school. 
I attended medical school at the Edward Via College of Osteopathic Medicine in Auburn (VCOM-Auburn) starting July 2020. However, I withdrew from medical school on December 2022 when I realized that being a physician was not going to fulfill me long-term.

After a year of pondering how I wanted to move forward with my future, I decided to apply for the M.S. in Data Science at UWF and started the program in the Spring 2024 semester. I enjoy math, statistics, programming, technology, and working with data, which is what drove me to apply.

I am honored to be a part of the CSDA Lab and I look forward to this great experience!
