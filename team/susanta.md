### Overview

Hello, I'm Susanta. I'm your typical music nerd meets tech and math. I enjoy everything tech and software, anything fresh and underdog. I moved to Florida from Ohio and in my opinion, hot & humid is better than shocking (static) surprises. Moisture over misery.

### Short description of your current research project:

I'm working on computer vision problems, basically figuring out what the computer sees and putting labels on what it sees.
